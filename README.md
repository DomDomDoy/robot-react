React Robot Server

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. <br />
Nginx should redirect dev.benolayinka.com to benolayinka.com:3000, where the app is listening.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
If you're editing via ssh, sometimes the number of file listeners exceeds the system capacity. Google the error to fix it, or just deal with lack of hot reloading.
