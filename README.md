# React Robot Server

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. <br />
If running on the server, nginx should redirect dev.benolayinka.com to benolayinka.com:3000 where the app is listening.
If running locally, the app is available at localhost:3000.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
If you're editing via ssh, sometimes the number of file listeners exceeds the system capacity. Google the error to fix it, or just deal with lack of hot reloading.
